#Uninstall the library. You should remove or disable the datapack before the next reload or DFH will load again.
#
#> [!CAUTION]
#> DFH's Virtual Health System changes the player's actual `max_health` and `max_absorption` attributs and it is impossible for an uninstall function to reset these for offline players
#>
#> Thus, DFH does not do this and you should be in charge of setting these 2 attributes back to normal.
